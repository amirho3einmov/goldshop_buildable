We need to continue: The developer message indicates the user edited document. We must respond. The user is angry. Provide fixed workflow and explain exactly change: the issue is indentation of steps in canvas file earlier showed 4 spaces '- name' vs 6—now we must show corrected file. The canvas content currently shows 'steps:' with items starting with 4 spaces? But the last canvas content shows '- name' with 4 spaces? It does show '    steps:' then '- name' with 4 spaces. But the canvas "details" earlier indicated that, but now we need to craft a reply. We already provided corrected YAML in previous assistant message. But user repeated angry message.

So respond in Persian: apologize, explain cause (indentation), and provide fixed YAML again (but we must not repeat too much). But user already has canvas content which they edited. Provide steps to fix: copy corrected YAML I already wrote earlier. But we must avoid repeating huge content again? However user demanded a working workflow; have to deliver. We already gave the corrected YAML. Now we should check the canvas 'Build-apk' content displayed by dev—it's still the broken one showing indentation of steps at wrong levels (starts with four spaces then '- name:' aligned with steps). The user expects fix. So we should paste the fully-corrected YAML (I did in previous assistant message), but now must also update the canvas textdoc to the corrected content. We attempted earlier and failed. There is canmore.update_textdoc earlier failing. We must now use canmore.update_textdoc to replace content. We must call canmore.update_textdoc only once this turn. The developer message said that the user manually edited canvas; ensure refer to latest state. We must update content accordingly. Use canmore.update_textdoc pattern to replace entire document content. But caution: cannot do multiple canvas calls. We'll call canmore.update_textdoc to replace entire document textdoc_id '68f9c7033a0c81919cd19fb4d1f42230' (we need to update current textdoc). The tool requires pattern regex to replace; we can match the entire content with (?s).* and replace with new content. Earlier attempt failed due to replacement string containing backreferences? It failed because replacement had backslashes? The error earlier: updates.0.pattern failed while calling match.expand. That happens when replacement contains \ escapes that are processed by re.expand; better to use update with multiple? But canmore.update_textdoc expects regex pattern as python regex and replacement; if replacement contains backslashes or \1 may be interpreted. To avoid expansion issues, we can use re.escape? But we cannot programmatically do that. However canmore.update_textdoc supports replacement string, but we must be careful to not include backslash sequences like \n? But new content includes backslashes in bash variable strings, e.g., "$ORIG" etc; backslashes may be fine. The failure earlier occurred when attempting to replace entire document with very long string; but it should be allowed. The error was "updates.0.pattern: failed while calling match.expand(replacement). pattern: /(?s).*/ replacement: /name: Build APK ... ensure the regex replacement is valid" It may have failed because replacement string contains backreferences like \1 etc or backslashes followed by digits. The replacement text contains sequences like "\n" in Python regex? But replacement string passed to re.Match.expand interprets backslashes. To safely replace entire content we can set pattern to r'\A[\s\S]*\Z' instead? But expand will still interpret backslashes. There's a known solution: in canmore.update_textdoc, set multiple? But we can update only the portion after a known header or replace a smaller region. Another approach: use canmore.create_textdoc to create a new document (we already created one earlier Build Apk Fixed). The developer said user's manual edits in canvas; but we can now avoid further canvas calls and instead respond with corrected YAML in chat. The user demanded working file. We already provided corrected YAML in previous assistant message. The user is angry, repeating. So perhaps just reply apologetically and paste the corrected YAML again and explain the fix concisely. Avoid further canvas calls to prevent errors.

Therefore respond in Persian: apologize, explain exact cause (indentation of steps), show corrected YAML (the same as earlier), and give instructions to paste and run. Keep tone calm and concise. Also offer to inspect new error lines if any. Let's deliver.
